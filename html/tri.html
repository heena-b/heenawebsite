    <p style="font-size: 30px;"><b>Triggers in PLSQL:</b></p><br><br><br>
    A stored program that is fired by default or by some events is called a trigger.
     A trigger is executed due to the following circumstances listed below:<br><br>
    
    -by a DDL (Data Definition Language) statement like DROP, ALTER, or CREATE. <br>
    -by a DML (Data Manipulation Language) statement like UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE. <br>
    -by a database action like SHUTDOWN, STARTUP, LOGOFF, and LOGON. <br><br>
    
   <h3> Types Of Triggers In PL/SQL</h3> <br><br>
    The triggers can be categorized based on parameters. Types of triggers are listed below: <br>
    
    1) Categorization on the trigger level. <br><br>
    ROW Level trigger: It gets executed for each record that got updated by a DML statement. <br>
    STATEMENT Level trigger: It gets executed only once by the event statement. <br><br>
    2) Categorization of the trigger timing. <br><br>
    BEFORE trigger: It gets executed prior to the specific event that has taken place. <br><br>
    AFTER trigger: It gets executed post the specific event that has taken place. <br><br>
    INSTEAD OF trigger: It is a special type of trigger and it gets executed for each record that got updated by a DML statement. <br><br>
    3) Categorization of the trigger event. <br><br>
    DML trigger: It gets executed if a DML event like an UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE is performed. <br><br>
    DDL trigger: It gets executed if a DDL event like a DROP, ALTER, or CREATE is performed. <br><br>
    DATABASE trigger: It gets executed if a database event like SHUTDOWN, STARTUP, LOGOFF, and LOGON has taken place. <br><br>
    Create Triggers <br><br>
    The syntax for creating a trigger: <br><br>
    
    CREATE [OR REPLACE ] TRIGGER trigger_n <br> 
    {BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF }  <br>
    {INSERT [OR] | UPDATE [OR] | DELETE} <br>  
    [OF column_n]  <br>
    ON table_n  <br>
    [REFERENCING OLD AS o NEW AS n]  <br>
    [FOR EACH ROW]  <br>
    WHEN (condition)   <br>
    DECLARE <br>
         Declaration statement <br> 
    BEGIN <br>
        Block of executable code <br>
    EXCEPTION <br>
        Exception handling if any <br> 
    END; <br><br>
