    <h3 style="text-align: center;">What is DBMS?</h3>
    Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data. A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data in the database. <br><br>

    DBMS manage the data, the database engine, and the database schema, allowing for data to be manipulated or extracted by users and other programs. This helps provide data security, data integrity, concurrency, and uniform data administration procedures.
    <br><br>
    DBMS optimizes the organization of data by following a database schema design technique called normalization, which splits a large table into smaller tables when any of its attributes have redundancy in values. DBMS offer many benefits over traditional file systems, including flexibility and a more complex backup system.<br><br>

    Database management systems can be classified based on a variety of criteria such as the data model, the database distribution, or user numbers. The most widely used types of DBMS software are relational, distributed, hierarchical, object-oriented, and network.
    <br><br>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Examples of DBMS</h3><br>
    There is a wide range of database software solutions, including both enterprise and open source solutions, available for database management. <br><br>
    
    Here are some of the most popular database management systems:
    <br><br>
   <b> Oracle</b> <br>
    Oracle Database is a commercial relational database management system. It utilizes enterprise-scale database technology with a robust set of features right out of the box. It can be stored in the cloud or on-premises. <br><br>
   <b> MySQL</b> <br>
    MySQL is a relational database management system that is commonly used with open-source content management systems and large platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube.
    <br><br>
   <b> SQL Server</b> <br>
    Developed by Microsoft, SQL Server is a relational database management system built on top of structured query language (SQL), a standardized programming language that allows database administrators to manage databases and query data.
    <br><br>
    Here we are studying about SQL and PL/SQL: <br><br>
   <p style="color: rgb(50, 167, 50);text-align: center;font-weight: bolder; text-decoration: underline;"><u>SQL</u></p>
   Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing and processing information in a relational database. A relational database stores information in tabular form, with rows and columns representing different data attributes and the various relationships between the data values. You can use SQL statements to store, update, remove, search, and retrieve information from the database. You can also use SQL to maintain and optimize database performance.

    <p style="color: rgb(50, 167, 50);text-align: center;font-weight: bolder; text-decoration: underline;"><u>PL/SQL</u></p> 
    PL/SQL is a block structured language that enables developers to combine the power of SQL with procedural statements.All the <br> statements of a block are passed to oracle engine all at once which increases processing speed and decreases the traffic. <br><br>
    Basics of PL/SQL: <br>
    PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extensions to the Structured Query Language (SQL). <br>
    PL/SQL is a combination of SQL along with the procedural features of programming languages. <br>
    Oracle uses a PL/SQL engine to processes the PL/SQL statements. <br>
    PL/SQL includes procedural language elements like conditions and loops. It allows declaration of constants and variables, procedures and functions, types and variable of those types and triggers. <br><br>
