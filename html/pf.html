    <h3>Procedures:</h3><br>
    A Procedure in PL/SQL is a subprogram unit that consists of a group of PL/SQL statements that can be called by name. Each procedure in PL/SQL has its own unique name by which it can be referred to and called. This subprogram unit in the Oracle database is stored as a database object. <br><br>

Below are the characteristics of Procedure subprogram unit in PL/SQL: <br>

1.Procedures are standalone blocks of a program that can be stored in the database. <br>
2.Call to these PLSQL procedures can be made by referring to their name, to execute the PL/SQL statements. <br>
3.It is mainly used to execute a process in PL/SQL. <br>
4.It can have nested blocks, or it can be defined and nested inside the other blocks or packages. <br>
5.It contains declaration part (optional), execution part, exception handling part (optional). <br><br>
The values can be passed into Oracle procedure or fetched from the procedure through parameters.
These parameters should be included in the calling statement. <br> <br>
A Procedure in SQL can have a RETURN statement to return the control to the calling block, but it cannot return any values through the RETURN statement.
Procedures cannot be called directly from SELECT statements. They can be called from another block or through EXEC keyword. <br><br>
Syntax: <br>
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE  <br>
procedure_name <br>
	( <br>
	parameterl IN/OUT datatype <br>
	.. <br>
	. <br>
	) <br>
[ IS | AS ] <br>
	declaration_part <br>
BEGIN
	execution part <br>
EXCEPTION <br>
	exception handling part <br>
END; <br><br>

<h3>Functions:</h3><br>
Functions is a standalone PL/SQL subprogram. Like PL/SQL procedure, functions have a unique name by which it can be referred. These are stored as PL/SQL database objects. Below are some of the characteristics of functions: <br><br>

1.Functions are a standalone block that is mainly used for calculation purpose. <br>
2.Function use RETURN keyword to return the value, and the datatype of this is defined at the time of creation. <br>
3.A Function should either return a value or raise the exception, i.e. return is mandatory in functions. <br>
4.Function with no DML statements can be directly called in SELECT query whereas the function with DML operation can only be called from other PL/SQL blocks. <br>
5.It can have nested blocks, or it can be defined and nested inside the other blocks or packages. <br>
6.It contains declaration part (optional), execution part, exception handling part (optional). <br>
7.The values can be passed into the function or fetched from the procedure through the parameters.These parameters should be included in the calling statement. <br>
8.A PL/SQL function can also return the value through OUT parameters other than using RETURN.
Since it will always return the value, in calling statement it always accompanies with assignment operator to populate the variables.
